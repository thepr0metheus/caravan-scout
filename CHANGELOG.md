# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-03

First public release (formerly `llm-easy-route-agent`).

- Heartbeats: host identity, GPU/CPU inventory, compute apps, local agents
  (host processes / docker / libvirt VMs) into the LAMA CARAVAN controller.
- Server cells: start/stop llama.cpp servers and generic command cells from
  controller-built configs; model download + cache; load progress reporting.
- Routing apply: re-points local OpenAI-compatible agents at their assigned
  proxy ports (`apply-routes.py`).
- Built-in pairing page on `:8092` — paste the controller address, done.
- Stdlib-only Python package `caravan_scout/`, systemd + launchd units,
  one-line installer.
