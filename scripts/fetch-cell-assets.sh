#
# The controller owns these files (its cells/ directory) and hands them to the
# fleet over /api/cell-assets. This repo used to keep its own copies and the
# installers laid those down; the two sides then drifted for months with nothing
# to notice it. Now there is one copy, upstream, and everything else fetches it.
#
# The scout also does this by itself before every command-cell start, so an
# installer that cannot reach the controller is not fatal — the files will
# arrive when the cell first runs. This exists so a freshly provisioned host has
# them right away, and so --install-only paths (venv prewarming) find them.
#
# Controller URL and fleet token come from the scout's own config.json.
